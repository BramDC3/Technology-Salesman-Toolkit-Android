## Technology

Technology Salesman Toolkit is a native Android application that supports Android devices starting at Android KitKat (API 19) all the way up to Android Pie (API 28). It has only one activity and multiple fragments. The architecture used to create TEST is MVVM. The app uses a Firebase backend. Multiple Android Jetpack components were used, including:
> - Data Binding
> - LiveData
> - Room
> - ViewModel
> - Navigation Component
> - ...

## Testaccount

I've provided an account people can use for testing purposes, but don't hesitate to create your own account! You can create an account with an email/password combination or by signing in with your Google account. You do, however, need to verify your email address if you create your account with the email/password combination.

## Documentation

The entire application has been provided with kDoc documentation. I've added documentation for almost every function and property used. Dokka has been used to create a handy "manual" of the application. The Dokka files can be found [here](https://github.com/HoGentTIN/native-apps-1-android-creative-app-BramDC3/tree/master/doc).
